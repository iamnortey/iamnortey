## Hi there 👋

I’m Isaac — a builder who enjoys making systems quieter, more reliable, and easier to reason about.

My work tends to sit at the intersection of:

- Large-scale cloud operations and incident response  
- Structured content and data modelling  
- Practical, real-world applications of AI and automation  

I care about calm, predictable systems and tools that actually get used, not just shipped.

---

### 🔭 What I’m currently focused on

- Designing and maintaining **reliable cloud-backed applications** with clear runbooks and observability.
- Building **structured content pipelines** for subjects, topics, lessons, and questions that can power search, analytics, and adaptive learning.
- Experimenting with **AI-assisted workflows** (RAG, semantic search, automation) that support people doing real work rather than replacing them.

---

### 🧱 How I think about systems

A few principles that guide how I build:

- **Data first** – get the schema and domain model right before trying to scale.
- **Operational clarity** – incidents, edge cases, and “what happens when this fails?” are part of the design, not an afterthought.
- **Sensible use of AI** – use models where they genuinely add leverage, and always leave room for human review and override.

I prefer small, composable building blocks over big, fragile frameworks.

### 🧰 Technologies I work with

**Application & UI**

- React, Next.js, React Native + Expo  
- TypeScript, utility-first styling, component-driven architectures  

**Content & Data**

- Sanity (headless CMS), PostgreSQL, SQLite  
- Supabase, Typesense / search-driven experiences  

**Cloud, Automation & AI**

- Node.js, Python, API-first backends  
- LLM prompt design for domain-specific workflows  
- Early-stage RAG patterns for knowledge and support use-cases

### 📌 Selected work (public samples)

- **Sanity Education Starter**  
  A generic Sanity Studio configuration for modelling subjects → topics → lessons → questions.  
  Designed as a safe, public starting point for education-focused content systems.  
  ➜ [sanity-education-starter](https://github.com/iamnortey/sanity-education-starter)

More small, focused examples will appear here over time as I carve out pieces of my internal work that are safe to open source.

### 🤝 How I like to collaborate

I enjoy working with people who care about:

- Clear problem definitions and thoughtful trade-offs  
- Systems that are observable, debuggable, and maintainable  
- Responsible use of AI in areas where reliability and trust matter  

If that sounds like you, I’m always open to comparing notes or exploring ways to work together.
